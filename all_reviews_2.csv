Jannillia Hamilton,"3770 Dryland Way Easton, PA",1,"I hate to even post this because I‚Äôve come here multiple times and love playa bowl.  But I went in today around 3pm to get a bowl. I ordered, the person who took my order was amazing. I completed my order and sat down for my my name to be called.   After about waiting for 10 mins for my name to be called to get my order  I started getting a bit antsy about my order but I figured maybe they were really busy. As I started to not think anything of it, they called the order for the customer that ordered after me. So now I‚Äôm confused. Where is my order?  I looked over at the counter where they make the bowls and noticed the kids were playing and talking and not making anything else. Then I noticed a bag. A bag almost falling backwards towards the bowl counter. I thought to myself, this couldn‚Äôt be my order. They didn‚Äôt call me.  This has to be an order to go. So I sat for a few minutes and then I said let me ask. I asked the girl behind the counter if that was my order and she said ‚Äúyeah‚Äù..no sorry. No, yes that‚Äôs your order. Just ‚Äúyeah‚Äù  like I bothered her!!!!  I literally was sitting in the place, right next to counter how did you miss ME but not the other customers who you called their names for them to walk up to the counter for their order. The only difference between us is, I don‚Äôt look like the other customers.   Not a good place for me‚Ä¶ I will never come back here. I will go downtown Easton.

I was underwhelmed the first time I went but have gone back several times since then and have been pleased overall with my bowls. If they weren't so understaffed (you'll be lucky if anyone is able to even look up and say hello when you walk in, although they are very friendly when you're placing an order), and the quality of the produce (especially the strawberries) was just a little better, then it would be a 5.

The strawberries on top were brown and rotten and the blue berries were mush. I showed the person the fruit and instead of remaking with new fruit they simply took the strawberries off and replaced them with more of the same! They left the blueberries, mushed and all right there!  The girls were more interested in their conversation and just slid the bowl on the counter.

I gave service the lower ranking of three stars however as the prices are absolutely outrageous. I don't mind paying a little bit extra for quality, but things like charging an extra dollar for a small drizzle of peanut butter, or the equivalent of a third of a banana is just outrageous. The bowls already average about $14 or $15, Have a nice day So charging that much extra for a tiny bit of extra ingredient seems out of bounds.

Otherwise, this is a fantastic place. Would recommend, but again it is anything but cheap.",N/A,N/A,N/A,5,3,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Now the not so good: The Acai portion of the bowl was frozen solid in some parts and the parts that were soft enough to eat had an abundance of ice chips in it, like they premade it, thawed it, put it back in the freezer then bought it back out to serve. It was really weird. Some I‚Äôm assuming the for efficiency sake they may premake the base instead of blending it for every order. I get that, because if it‚Äôs busy blending to every order is going to be time consuming. No problem, i‚Äôm all for efficiency, What I‚Äôm not for is a lack of quality in the final product. My bowl would have been a 10 had the A√ßa√≠ been smooth enough to eat. I was so disappointing and for the money I spent, the acai being partly completely frozen with huge ice chips in it was unacceptable.

I‚Äôve had many a Acai bowl before but this one, aside from the really fresh and beautifully cut fruit, left me very disappointed in the Playa Bowl experience. Maybe this was just a one off mishap, I would hope so as I know this place is popular. Perhaps it just wasn‚Äôt the right day for me to try.",Take out,N/A,$10‚Äì20,1,4,4,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

I asked what her name was ... it was Tory. I said thanks again Tory... not sure at all why I recieved an attitude. Then someone at the counter asked what the issue was, and I said that I said thank you and was given an eye roll .... I‚Äôm beyond confused as I didn‚Äôt say anything the entire time in the store. Manager Sarah, after asking what happened got cocky as well and said I need to leave ... as she asked me what happened? None of this makes sense. Definitely will not be back even on my own dollar.

Alonso mutt Kinnard,"4 Airport Square North Wales, PA",1,"I‚Äôve been a long time customer of this establishment. It‚Äôs nothing like spending your money and getting poor service. I did a little experiment due to my bowls being shorted fruit when I walked in as opposed to ordering the bowl online. 3-4 times I walked in, ordered a bowl and got a piss poor bowl. I‚Äôm not one to be confrontational so I left. Recently I orders a bowl on line under a different name and got a bowl that was unbelievable. A lot of fruit and the overall bowl was amazing. Today I order a bowl and it was piss poor. The cashier was nice. When she asked me my name I gave it to her. People were receiving there bowls according to when they placed their orders but not me. 3 people received their order before me and when my order was ready the girl said ‚Äúpura vida‚Äù which is not my name. Everyone else name was used why not mine? I was asked my name in the beginning of my experience, if you‚Äôre not going to use my name then don‚Äôt ask for it. I seen other peoples bowls who ate inside the store and their bowls were full like my online bowl was. I walk outside look in my bag and saw this piss poor bowl I received. I‚Äôll attach two photos one will be the one from today and one will be from when I ordered on line. I‚Äôm truly disappointed in this service. If you‚Äôre not going to treat people EQUALLY and with the same respect as everyone else then you shouldn‚Äôt work in customer service.

Juanita Mole,"4 Airport Square North Wales, PA",2,"I  love the bowls so much I order at least two bowls a week. I‚Äôve noticed lately at this location, the customer service is declining and if you order online your bowl comes out totally different versus ordering in the store. When ordered in store it‚Äôs skimpy with the fruit, fruits mushy, bruised fruit and doesn‚Äôt taste the same. But when I order online it‚Äôs loaded with fruit, the fruit looks fresher and the taste is better. Almost feels like when they see me they just throw anything together. ‚Ä¶ my overall experience used to be better when they first opened. I hope they get it together because I don‚Äôt like to spend my money in places where they don‚Äôt appreciate a loyal customer.

Carrie Dennis,"4 Airport Square North Wales, PA",1,"I've been to this Playa Bowls a few times and each time has been disappointing. The girls working there are clearly miserable and need to be reminded that paying customers are not the enemy. I asked if there was an option for unsweetened Acai and was told she didn't know, all the Acai was the same. I got a smoothie with acai, banana, strawberries and coconut milk hoping it would be less sweet than the bowls I've had in the past and it was worse...so disgustingly sweet I couldn't drink it. There is no way there isn't some other form of sweetener added to these bowls/smoothies. If I'm spending a stupid amount of money for a healthier option for myself and kids I'd like to be aware of ALL the (added) ingredients in my order. And if i ask for a less sweet option, at least give me some form of a thoughtful response. If you're looking for a healthy lunch or snack try Raw Replenish or another small Smoothie/Bowl place.

Bhavik Patel,"4 Airport Square North Wales, PA",1,"As a business owner myself, I understand the impact of one-star reviews, so I typically avoid leaving them unless absolutely necessary. Unfortunately, my experience at Playa Bowl today left me with no choice. The customer service was extremely disappointing.

I ordered a custom bowl with an A√ßa√≠/Mango base, along with banana, blueberry, and maple syrup. However, when I received my order, it contained granola, which I cannot eat. I politely asked for the bowl to be remade according to my custom instructions, but the girl at the counter refused. She explained that granola is automatically included in every bowl, and I should have specifically requested its removal.

This completely defeats the purpose of a ""custom"" bowl if additional ingredients are automatically added without clear communication. Despite my request, the employee refused to remake the bowl or offer a refund.

Given this experience, I won't be returning to Playa Bowl. Instead, I'll be taking my business to the newly opened A√ßa√≠ bowl place in the neighborhood.",Take out,Other,$10‚Äì20,3,1,1,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

A girl with blond hair in a low, messy bun, with green pants and a black t-shirt with a dark grey sweatshirt had no customer service skills. I‚Äôve had a rude encounter with her before. She was cold, didn‚Äôt even greet me and in the harshest tone asked me ‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù I was so taken back by her attitude and complete disrespect. After she prepared my bowl, she carelessly tossed it on the counter without handing it to me and bleakly said,‚ÄùHere you go. I am absolutely horrified and appalled by such horrible treatment. This was the worst experience I had ever had at Playa Bowls. And my bowl was a lot emptier than it usually is and messy.

Faye,"4 Airport Square North Wales, PA",1,"They forgot the honey drizzle to both of the pura vida bowls we ordered, barely gave us any granola, & barely gave me any strawberries & blueberries which practically made up my whole bowl. The a√ßa√≠ base wasn‚Äôt smoothie-like but had a chopped ice consistency & didn‚Äôt taste as sweet & good like it usual does. It tasted like there was a key ingredient missing in it & the bowls looked like they ran out of things & were trying to stretch it out. I am a frequent customer & this is the second time they have slighted my smoothie bowl. For how expensive Playa Bowls is, experiences like this should not be happening. It really makes me feel like I‚Äôve been robbed & slighted because I didn‚Äôt get my moneys worth at all & am very disappointed with my experience. I honestly wanted a refund given how much money I paid for the bowls but I sadly was already home. The employees working this shift have no customer service skills & the girl taking my order seemed to really be going through it. I came in a little before 6pm or so.

Carol Hoy,"4 Airport Square North Wales, PA",1,Walked into the store at 6:41 (posted closing time is 7pm). There were at least 6 people behind the counter who greeted us with dirty looks. It was so uncomfortable that we had to ask if it was too late for us to order. One of the girls shook her head yes and said they were unable to make us anything because they needed to start their close. Very disappointed. Closing at 7 should mean you are done serving customers at 7.  We arrived almost 20 minutes before posted closing time.

Unfortunately some of the employees are stealing from their customers. When you order if you say no to a receipt and use a credit card some employees will add on a high tip for themselves. They have done it to me on 2 occasions now and I watched them do it to each person in line behind me. Very sad. When I went back and requested a copy of my receipt and asked why all of a sudden there was a tip added when I tipped them in cash, she got irritated and said it must have been my fault.",N/A,N/A,N/A,5,1,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

I returned the next few days and purchased a teriyaki poke bowl before work, which was great, also I had a Nutella oatmeal bowl and the coconut craze and they were both great as well.

Gabrielle,"310 E 3rd St Bethlehem, PA",2,"I‚Äôve always been a huge fan of Playa Bowls, and this location was no exception. Love their food. My specific problem was today‚Äôs experience. I spent $18 ‚Äúbuilding my own bowl‚Äù. I got an a√ßa√≠ base, strawberries, bananas, brown sugar, peanut butter, and extra peanut butter. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. When I received my order, it had granola, which I did not ask for. The blonde behind the counter curtly exclaimed that ‚Äúit comes with granola no matter what so you need to ask for no granola.‚Äù Although her attitude caught me off guard, I replied that I was so sorry- that I had ordered that exact thing before, exactly the same way, and didn‚Äôt need to ask for ‚Äúno granola.‚Äù She interrupted me before I was finished to tell me more angrily that, ‚Äúwell that‚Äôs always been the rule so yeah..‚Äù and walked away without letting me finish. ‚ÄúBut we‚Äôll remake it,‚Äù she said with a sarcastic, fake smile. I didn‚Äôt dare try to say anything else because of how rude she was being at this point and walked over to my table. While waiting, I walked around the storefront looking for where it said granola was included in a ‚Äúbuild your own bowl.‚Äù I truly just wanted to see it to validate my mistake. Alas, I could not find it. I also noticed it was not busy at all, and we were actually the only ones waiting at the time with another guy who was ALSO WAITING FOR HIS ORDER TO BE REDONE BECAUSE THEY MESSED IT UP. Maybe he forgot to ask for no granola??? Hmm‚Ä¶ After my order was called the second time, I wanted to try one more time to apologize to this girl. Kill them with kindness, you know? ‚ÄúI just wanted to apologize again.. I was here a couple weeks ago and it didn‚Äôt come with granola so I went off that experience..‚Äù and AGAIN, before I could finish, this girl cuts me off and says, ‚Äúwell that has always been the rule since we opened so I‚Äôm not sure how that happened‚Äù with an attitude. I know you can all hear her saying it. ‚ÄúWell I just wanted to apologize..‚Äù and she cuts me off AGAIN and says ‚ÄúJust let us know next time‚Äù as she walks away! I totally get that they‚Äôre working and they‚Äôre busy, but this girl would not give me the time of day. Looking back, I tried way too hard to apologize but I felt bad for my mistake. Later, I asked another employee for a lid and bag. She stopped everything to get me what I needed and did NOT try to rush me away. To that girl, thank you for helping me and showing me not all Playa Bowl Bethlehem employees are rude. Blondie, you left a bad taste in my mouth. Which is sad because I love this place.

Mackenzie Searfoss,"310 E 3rd St Bethlehem, PA",1,"This is one of the worst playa bowls around. The lady who took our order was amazing, the lady who made our bowls did a terrible job. There was supposed to be extra Nutella on both bowls and there wasn‚Äôt. As well I asked for no granola on the bottom and still got granola on the bottom of my bowl.  Our bowls were only filled half way. There was barely any fruit on either bowl. For the price for paying for 2 people should be way less if this is how the food will be.

Lauren Garges,"310 E 3rd St Bethlehem, PA",4,"This was a fun new find in Bethlehem. My kale bowl was delicious. The base was almost a sorbet-like texture of completely smooth kale with some type of sweetener because it had no bitter kale taste whatsoever. The granola, honey, chia seeds and banana and  strawberries on top were all fresh and abundant. My daughter's coconut bowl was not as successful. We both agreed the coconut base, kind of a mixture of yogurt and sorbet, had very little flavor and she didn't finish it. I finished mine and honestly wished I didn't. There is no easy way to take ""leftovers"" home as the sorbet-like bases will just turn into a runny mess. But what an excess of sugar and calories. The portion sizes are by no means ""healthy"" - the bowls are quite large and really probably the right size for sharing.

I asked him repeatedly for a pacific a√ßa√≠ bowl but he made me something completely different and even added extra Nutella while I asked him not to. I paid $15 for a bowl that I didn‚Äôt want and got very poor customer service. This young man clearly doesn‚Äôt want to provide any good service. The reason I didn‚Äôt speak up because I figured by his bad attitude he‚Äôs most likely not going to fix it and cause unnecessary problems to this simple matter.

Ada Nancy,"1804 Chestnut Street Philadelphia, PA",3,"Had an acai bowl. Okay, but too sweet... You can definitely tell there is added sugar. The granola is also very sweet... Way too much sugar. Eating the bowl was like a sugar bomb. It is not surprising to me because I did ask a worker how the different bowl bases are made (was specifically asking what the mango base was blended with): she told me she didn't know as none of the bowl bases are made on site, they all come as a pre-made mix. The acai bowl definitely tastes this way-- added sugar, preservatives, not fresh. I would definitely skip the honey topping next time because there was already too much sugar.

My comparator is SoBol, my regular place (tried Playa Bowls because they were closed). Sobol's acai and other bowls are blended fresh on site, made to order, and sweetened with apple juice. You can absolutely tell the difference in the taste and freshness... In fact, sometimes if I want a Sobol acai bowl a little on the sweeter side I have to request extra honey or agave.

Of note, Playa Bowls wins on selection. The menu is huge. Including steel cut oatmeal bowls which I would like to try. But all the frozen bowls just taste like artificial desserts. I sampled the mango bowl and it was SOOO sweet, and really did not taste natural and fresh at all.

SUMMARY: Okay place for an acai bowl, bowls have added sugar, ask for honey / agave on the side or skip all together. SoBol is a far superior choice for an acai bowl, and pricing is pretty much identical. Playa Bowls has a much bigger menu, so if you crave an acai bowl alternative (e.g. frozen mango base, green base, oatmeal)-- you may prefer it.

Erik Snyder,"1804 Chestnut Street Philadelphia, PA",1,"My partner and I just went to this Playa Bowl which we had been to quite often. We placed our order for two smoothies, nothing fancy and waited. The store was loud (the music was very loud) and busy but after 25 minutes and 6 or so orders went out that were placed after ours I asked if they had called our name. The one male service rep was apologetic and said they missed it and it would be right out. There was a short female service rep who made the smoothies and then called our name. One of the cups had smoothie all on the outside of it and my partner said ‚Äúdude, can you please clean the stuff off the cup it‚Äôs a mess?‚Äù To which she turned around got napkins and handed it to my partner and said ‚Äúnow you can clean it off yourself.‚Äù I replied to her that ‚Äúthere was no need to get an attitude because we had been waiting patiently for 30 minutes for 2 smoothies.‚Äù At which point she said that we ‚Äúwere entitled and that other people were waiting before us.‚Äù Her fellow employees had to hold her back and tell her to stop talking and we left. We felt extremely embarrassed by the interaction. She was very unprofessional and we aren‚Äôt going to Playa Bowl again.

There were 3 employees, and it seemed like only 1 person was making orders. Meanwhile, a group of 5 friends came in after me and waited quite a while before the cashier acknowledged them. A young girl with long braids was drinking a smoothie with her gloves on. A few minutes after she took a pause from her smoothie is when she called my name for my order. Food: I was not pleased with my bowls. The pineapple was poorly cut, and I had to spit a few pieces out because of the skin. There was skin on the kiwi also. Not to mention that 2 layers of granola were included(bottom and top) Seemed like I was being ripped off for more base. A manager should have been on duty. I'll continue to get my bowls from the Wayne location.  The young girls there are swift and efficient. Better quality for a $15 bowl.",Take out,N/A,N/A,3,3,4,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Rebecca DeMarre,"4034 Walnut Street Philadelphia, PA",3,"Ridiculously overpriced!! They use canned fruit, so they really don't have any excuse to be charging the prices they do. There are places nearby that sell a√ßa√≠ bowls and smoothies for half the price.

The customization options are excellent (they have a ton), and I love some of their custom bowls like the Electric Mermaid. But their pricing is extortionate: it makes no sense to get a custom bowl when pricing starts at $16 for a base with no ingredients added, and they charge you $1 for any single ingredient you add.

The oatmeal is bland and flavorless without sugar (which they charge you an extra $1 for). I ordered the Nutella Oatmeal Bowl and they really skimped on the fruits: maybe 1/4 of a banana and 2 strawberries with a few flakes of prepackaged shredded coconut. Seriously?

They recently set up a brick wall out of cardboard boxes on part of the service counter asking customers to order online, which is also super obnoxious.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã",Take out,Breakfast,$10‚Äì20,3,3,3,,Would not recommend,Menu is all vegetarian,Great vegan/gluten free options,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Niki Rees Hamilton,"236 S 11th St Philadelphia, PA",3,Love their super fresh bowls and smoothies. However the service and atmosphere could be improved. The wait to order with 1 person ahead of me - 10 minutes. Wait to receive my simple bowl and smoothie order -15 minutes. Employees moving like zombie slow. Painfully slow.  Others in line gave up and left. The atmosphere is fun but unfortunately it was overpowered by a group of very loud loudmouths who acted like it was their place. Annoying. Decided to take it to go.  Will try other spots nearby next time. Way too slow. Who has time for this?,Dine in,Lunch,$20‚Äì30,5,1,1,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
"Plano, Lucas","236 S 11th St Philadelphia, PA",5,"Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow........... I'm not one to write reviews for literally anything, but I have to document my experience that I had today at Playa Bowls.  I haven't heard much of this place before today, so I didn't know what to expect going into this place, but man was I pleasantly surprised.  I was immediately greeted by the cozy beach aesthetic of the establishment, I can see why they call it PLAYA Bowls haha!!!  The only bad part about it was not being able to stay to eat at this exquisite place, as I had gotten my order for takeout.  As I was walking up to the counter I was greeted by the two nicest people I have ever met in the city, Hannah and Kira!  They were extremely knowledgable on the history of the establishment and the city as well, so keeping a conversation wasn't a problem at all.  They made me feel so welcome, like it was my second home.  They greeted me, kindly took my order, and sat me down at my table which is everything a customer could ask for!  While I was patiently waiting for my order, I had great conversations with the two employees that made the waiting worth it!!  The couple minutes that it took to make my complex bowl felt like mere seconds went by, it was a magical experience.  As I was leaving I started to feel somewhat sad, since this place quickly felt like home.  I was surprised at how this place made me feel so welcome to the point where I didn't want to leave!  I would truly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a quick bite of something fresh and exciting in the city. Infinity out of 10!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I will be coming back MANY more times.",Take out,Dinner,$10‚Äì20,5,5,5,Custom Acai Bowl- Includes Granola TPD,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Gaurav Shah,"807 N 2nd Street Philadelphia, PA",4,"This was my first Playa Bowl experience. I stopped by for a juice and this place was busy which is always a good sign. There were only 3 employees working.
We ordered a Green room juice and green smoothie with some customisations. The employee working on the register had hard time with the tablet (probably couldn‚Äôt find the key to add chia seeds) which is not a big deal.

As we were waiting for 10minutes in, one of the employees who was done with her shift looked angry. Looked like she was having a bad day and started screaming and talking loud for some reason.

The green room juice was good but the green smoothie wasn‚Äôt the best (I have had some great tasting green smoothies)

Overall the location and atmosphere were great. Wish the service was faster and next time they give our juice and smoothie faster. Management should hire more employees.

My bowl must've been left over from the night before because the acai was frozen and was full of ice chips. But what really let me down was the free iced coffee. I was looking forward to it all morning. I attached a pic. The milk/ cream was curdled... it tasted horrendous, I could't drink it. I wouldn't usually write a review- but if I'm paying $15+ for a bowl full of ice chips and an expired coffee, I expect so much more.
